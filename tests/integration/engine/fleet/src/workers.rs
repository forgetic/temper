//! The scripted workers (worker-model.md, sections 2 and 4, as the fleet
//! meets them): each dials in, says hello with its slots, the workstreams its
//! checkouts hold, the runs it hosts and the answers it keeps, then sends
//! those answers again; hosts what it is assigned, refusing as busy beyond its
//! slots or for a run it hosts another attempt of, and as invalid by chance;
//! runs each to its planned end, or winds it down once cancelled; relays host
//! calls and withdraws them past their deadline; bounces inbound events by
//! chance and tells facts; keeps each answer until it is acknowledged; and,
//! out of contact past its own grace, cancels its runs itself.
