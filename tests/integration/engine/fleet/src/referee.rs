//! What the fleet's scenarios expect, held by a referee (testing-pyramid.md,
//! 5.2) that sees what the scripted workers see and do, what goes down their
//! channels, and what the scripted parent asks and hears; never the fleet's
//! state.
//!
//! Safety, checked on every observation:
//!
//! - no worker is assigned more runs than its slots, the answers it holds
//!   for the engine counted;
//! - never two live attempts of a run's workstream: no worker is assigned an
//!   attempt of a run while any worker hosts another of it, and no attempt
//!   is assigned twice;
//! - nothing reaches a worker for an attempt the parent cancelled, or that
//!   ended (answered, presumed lost or withdrawn), but a cancel;
//! - every attempt the parent starts ends once: with the answer its worker
//!   gave, or presumed lost, withdrawn or refused, never two of these.
//!
//! Liveness, as deadlines of its own: every attempt the parent starts ends
//! within a bound the world sets.
//!
//! It injects what belongs to no fake: a worker's channel dropping, for a
//! while or for good, and the engine restarting.
