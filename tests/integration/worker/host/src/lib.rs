//! A simulated world for the worker's host sub-model (programming-model.md,
//! 4.5 and 11; worker-model.md, sections 4 and 9): the host, with the world as
//! its parent, a scripted engine assigning it runs ([`engine`]), and the
//! parent's capabilities scripted ([`parent`]): workspaces that prepare,
//! push and save, and agents whose runs make host calls, yield, park, end,
//! fail, hang and get stopped. One loop drives them, deterministically from a
//! seed.
//!
//! The world owns the clock and the seeds, and stands in for everything around
//! the host: the top level that will route between it, the engine link and
//! its siblings (its grace on losing contact, the report on coming back, and
//! shutdown included), the checkout and agent sub-models, and the protocol
//! layers below. It checks the contracts as it goes: every assignment is
//! answered exactly once, a refused one at once and never admitted, one beyond
//! the limits refused for what is beyond them; nothing is saved or released
//! while the run's agent may still be running or a push is in flight; a slot
//! is taken from admission until the run has answered, and the run answers
//! only once it has left live and all of it is released; a stale attempt, or
//! the attempt hosted assigned again, never acts; a worker shutting down
//! admits nothing more; inbound events reach a run once each, in the order
//! sent; every host call is answered once, every call of a run that has left
//! live (a cancelled one among them) as unavailable, those relayed in flight
//! as it leaves, and a push in flight then with how it went; a run is
//! answered as it first said it finishes, also when it says so winding down
//! after a stop; and the report on coming back lists exactly the runs
//! admitted and not answered. Once it settles: nothing in flight, every slot
//! free, no call open, every workspace released and every agent gone.
