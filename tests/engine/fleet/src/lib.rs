//! A domain world for the engine's fleet child domain (programming-model.md,
//! 4.5; testing-strategy.md, 2.2; domain/engine.md, section 8): the fleet,
//! with the world as its parent, driven by one loop, deterministically from a
//! seed.
//!
//! The world owns the clock and the seeds, and stands in for everything
//! around the fleet: the protocol layer and the network, as channels that
//! carry messages in order after a latency and lose what is in flight when
//! they close; workers that dial in, say hello with their slots, the
//! workstreams they hold and what they host, host runs that end, park or
//! fail after a drawn time, refuse some assignments as invalid and some as
//! busy, relay host calls and wait for their answers, bounce inbound events
//! and tell facts, wind down when cancelled, keep their answers until they
//! are acknowledged and send them again after every hello, and, out of
//! contact past their own grace, cancel their runs themselves; and the
//! parent, scripted to the contract the work hub keeps with the fleet: it
//! starts runs, makes each answer durable after a drawn time and only then
//! acknowledges it, keeps its claims (answered ones not yet durable among
//! them) across restarts and adopts them after one, saying when it has
//! loaded and starting nothing new before, cancels some attempts and
//! replaces others with a newer one, gives up on those that take too long,
//! sends inbound events, answers relayed calls after a latency, and retries
//! what fails.
//!
//! It checks the contracts as it goes: every start and adoption ends exactly
//! once, every relayed call is answered exactly once, and every payload the
//! parent hands the fleet is echoed exactly once. Its referee ([`referee`])
//! holds the fleet to what the scenarios expect, from what the workers and
//! the parent see (no worker forgets an answer before it is durable among
//! them), and injects channels that drop and engine restarts. And
//! the invariants once it settles: nothing in flight, nothing tracked by the
//! fleet, nothing hosted or held by a worker in contact, every item done, and
//! the referee's verdict passed.
