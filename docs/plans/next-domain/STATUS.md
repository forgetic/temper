# Migration status

Local branches only; nothing has been pushed. Counts below are the full
workspace gate at the listed tip; fuzzy runs retain one ignored finding.
Detailed implementation and review evidence belongs in commit messages.

## What remains open

**00 — groundwork**

- Target Forgejo v16.0.5; read job logs through its API.
- Preserve v15 observations; capture v16 log exchanges in protocol work.

**01 — authority**

- Backfill boundary and module documentation; implementation is complete.

**02 — tasks**

- Finish retired-source and recurring funding depth in 02e.
- Restore inbox, amendment and move surface only with actual root routes.
- Keep 02d–e parked through documentation/style gates, then resume in plan order.

**03 — people**

- Backfill boundary and module documentation.
- Resume pages, derived inboxes and remaining increments after 06a.

**04 — forge connector**

- Keep 04b–f parked; preserve the in-progress client and review repairs.
- Use bounded Forgejo v16.0.5 API job logs for failed-CI repair briefs.
- Resume client, connector policy and top in plan order after 06a's audit.

**05 — runtime**

- Keep 05f–g parked; preserve native run/tool work on its branch.
- Verify documented code regeneration and drift tests for all goldens before 05g.
- Carry remaining v2 watchdog, cancellation and kill coverage into runtime verification.

**06 — root**

- Complete documentation backfill and five style checks before resuming child depth.
- Continue 06b–f: run, tool, people and forge routes; broader restarts and worst-case worlds.
- Recovery after terminal commit but before ACK/result release remains owed.

**07 — cutover**

- Move engine protocol and system worlds after the new root's stories pass.
- Preserve the frozen legacy behavior until the single cutover; then delete it.

**08 — after**

- Implement notes and contractions after cutover.
- Write separate store, web, credentials, forge protocol and iteration/shell plans.
- Implementing those lower layers remains outside this migration.
