//! The calls a conversation's LLM makes of the run, its delegated tools: each
//! an entity from its `Delegated` to its one `Return`, under the `calls`
//! limit, so that a call's slot never waits on the reclaim point.
//!
//! A call is named by its conversation's token for it, which the run cannot
//! echo back (no record carries the run's name for it to the session), so a
//! bounded map finds a call by its conversation and that name, for a
//! `Withdraw`.
//!
//! Each call has a deadline, its conversation's own expiry, and the run runs
//! the race (5.3): an alarm per call, under the same limit. Past it, the run
//! stops what the call is doing, and returns it as timed out once that has
//! settled, so a call never returns with anything it started still in flight.
//! A conversation withdraws a call only as it closes, and a call its deadline
//! stopped first stays stopped for that.
