//! What the fleet tells whoever watches the engine (engine-domain.md, section
//! 11): a fact for each thing that happened, content-free (kinds and counts,
//! never a run's name or a payload), in a bounded queue the parent drains at
//! its own pace.
//!
//! Facts are outside the boundary's flow control: they are not requests, take
//! no room in `out`, and when the queue is full they are dropped and counted.
//! Nothing the fleet decides depends on whether a fact was kept.
