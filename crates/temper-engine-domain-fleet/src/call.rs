//! What the fleet relays between the parent and the runs (engine-domain.md,
//! section 8; worker-domain.md, 4.2): inbound events down, a run's host calls
//! up and their answers back, its bounces and its facts up. Each goes through
//! only while its attempt is the parent's live claim; what comes for an
//! attempt cancelled, replaced, lost or answered is dropped (attempts are
//! fenced), and an inbound event that reaches no worker goes back to the
//! parent, which keeps it.
//! Worker inputs also require the live claim's current hosting channel;
//! foreign channels and channels lost or replaced cannot originate them.
//!
//! A relayed call is the parent's to answer, exactly once: the fleet keeps it
//! until the parent does, whatever becomes of its attempt meanwhile, and
//! passes the answer down only if the attempt is still the live claim, on a
//! worker in contact. A call beyond the room for calls is dropped, and its
//! run withdraws it past its own deadline.
