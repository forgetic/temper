//! The workers in contact (engine-domain.md, sections 2 and 8): each known by
//! its channel, from the hello it says first on it until the channel is lost.
//! A worker that comes back dials a new channel, and is known again by what
//! its hello lists: the fleet needs no other name for it.
//!
//! A hello is the worker's entrance. It is turned away, its channel to be
//! closed, only if the fleet has no room for another worker. Its slots are
//! used up to the limit, and the workstreams it lists up to the limit, each
//! within the bytes of a key. Each run it lists, up to the slots a worker
//! may have, is kept, cancelled again, acknowledged or found (see the
//! attempts' table); one beyond them, or beyond the room the fleet keeps for
//! listings, is cancelled and not tracked; and past twice the slots, a
//! listing is dropped and counted, to bound what a hello emits. A second
//! hello on a channel breaks the worker's contract, and is counted and
//! dropped.
//!
//! A lost channel's attempts are kept for the grace, adrift, and the worker
//! is forgotten. A worker that refuses an assignment as busy is shutting
//! down, or fuller than the fleet knew: nothing more is placed on it until
//! it frees a slot.
//!
//! Placement takes a worker in contact with a free slot that holds the
//! workstream's checkout, the first in the order of the protocol's names for
//! the channels; or, with none, the one with the most free slots. A worker
//! holds the workstreams its hello listed and those of the runs placed on it
//! since: placing one beyond the room evicts the one used longest ago.
