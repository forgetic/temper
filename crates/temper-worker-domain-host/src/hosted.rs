//! Hosted runs: one run on the worker, from its assignment to its one answer
//! (worker-domain.md, 4.2).
//!
//! An `Assign` admits a run to a slot, or refuses it at the entrance. An
//! admitted run has its workspace prepared, then its agent started on the
//! charter, resumed from the snapshot if there is one. While it is live,
//! inbound events go down to it as they arrive, and its host calls come up: a
//! push is served through the workspace, a forge read or an outlet is relayed
//! to the engine and its answer routed back. It parks or ends as it decides,
//! or fails; then the tail: its agent is stopped, its unfinished work saved if
//! the assignment asks and the run did not end with a landed change, its
//! workspace released, and the engine answered, which frees the slot. A cancel
//! (from the engine, or from the top level for every run: lost contact,
//! shutdown) or a fault of the agent takes the same tail.
//!
//! The first ending decided wins, but for the run's own: a run the worker
//! cancelled (the engine, lost contact, shutdown) may still say how it
//! finishes as it winds down, and what it says before its agent has gone is
//! the answer. A push that lands as it winds down is its outcome
//! (agent-domain.md, 4.4). A cancel it reports is then the worker's, for the
//! cancel's reason. A run whose agent was faulted is not heard after the fault
//! (the agent child domain tells at most one of the two), but for its wall
//! time, which is told only once the grace is up: until then the run may still
//! say how it finishes, and a cancel it reports is told as the wall time's
//! fault. Only a run that says nothing before its agent has gone is answered as
//! the worker stopped it.
//!
//! A run's transition table:
//!

//! state       event                         next        emits

//! A pushed or relayed event moves its call (the `call` module), and leaves
//! the run where it is; so does a withdrawn one. A withdrawn relay is
//! answered at once, and what the engine sends for it after is dropped; a
//! withdrawn push goes on, and is answered with how it went once it settles:
//! a push cannot be abandoned half way. A stopping run has settled once its agent has gone
//! and its push in flight, if it has one, has settled; it then saves if the
//! assignment asks, unless it ended with a landed change, and otherwise
//! releases its workspace and answers. That follows from the state, in one
//! place ([`conclude`]), which also retires a run once it is Closed.
//!
//! A stop is sent whenever a run leaves live with its agent there, also after
//! the run has said how it finishes or its agent was faulted: the agent
//! child domain is winding it down then anyway, and a stop changes nothing.
//!
//! Every other cell is unreachable by the contracts: the workspace's (one
//! terminal per request) and the agent's (`Started` first unless the agent
//! could not be started, then what its run does, then one `Gone`). Nothing
//! the engine sends reaches a run whose attempt it does not name, nor a
//! Closed run, which leaves the names as it closes.
//!
//! Inbound events that come while the run is not live yet are held, in the
//! order they came, up to the limit, and delivered as its agent starts; past
//! the limit they are bounced, and the engine keeps them. One its agent could
//! not take is bounced to the engine the same way. A run that never
//! goes live drops what it held: its answer says it took nothing.
