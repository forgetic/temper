//! What a task may do, as an owned value with a preorder, its carved funding,
//! and the rules each action passes (domain/authority.md, sections 3–10;
//! programming-model.md, 4.5).
//!
//! Pure policy over values supplied by the engine's root: resource coverage,
//! authority order and accounting over snapshots. [`Domain`] holds only the
//! deployment's rules, project policies and their admission limits. It keeps
//! no task, funding numbers, connector or clock. The tasks child keeps the
//! numbers; accounting answers say what they become. Connector kind orders
//! are supplied as validated [`Implies`] data. Checks allocate nothing,
//! refuse oversized inputs at admission and write every independent reason
//! into caller-reserved bounded queues. [`needs`] constructs an owned value;
//! policy events update the bounded table and emit one lifecycle fact.

//!
//! Entry contracts: `check_*` borrow admitted snapshots, return one answer
//! and write bounded findings; the root supplies connector verdicts and commits
//! allowed numbers with actions exactly once (domain/authority.md, sections
//! 7–9). `at_most`, coverage and accounting functions are pure value queries,
//! not child event protocols. Callers bound owned inputs before these queries;
//! `needs` copies bounded data and its output is counted by the caller.
//! `step` alone updates the policy table and emits one terminal `PolicyFact`
//! per event, with free room `POLICY_MAX_OUT` (domain/authority.md, section 6).
//! `max_out` bounds finding room and `worst_case` bounds retained policy heap;
//! callers count question payloads and queues (domain/authority.md, section 11).
//! This child never authenticates people, discovers task standing or funding
//! links, executes effects, or recognizes duplicate settlements.
